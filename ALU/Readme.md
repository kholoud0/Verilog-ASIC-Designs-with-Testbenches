<h1>16-bit ALU Design</h1>
This 16-bit ALU performs a variety of unsigned arithmetic, logic, shift, and comparison operations based on a 4-bit control signal (ALU_FUN), according to the included ALU function table, and provides flags to indicate operation types and carry/borrow conditions. The design includes a testbench that verifies functionality across multiple test cases.
